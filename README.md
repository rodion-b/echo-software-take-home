# Senior Software Engineer - Take-Home Exercise: FireGo Wallet Service

Welcome to the Echo Senior Software Engineer take-home exercise! We're excited to see your skills in action.

## 🚀 About Echo

We are an early-stage company building innovative solutions in the digital asset space. We value autonomy, technical excellence, and a proactive approach to problem-solving.

## 🎯 The Challenge

Your task is to build a backend service in Go, named "FireGo Wallet Service," that interacts with the Fireblocks API to perform basic cryptocurrency wallet operations. This service should expose a set of RESTful API endpoints.

The primary goal is to assess your ability to read and understand cryptocurrency/API documentation, collaborate effectively with our team, and solve problems independently when possible. We're looking for engineers who know when to work autonomously and when to seek guidance, particularly around asynchronous collaboration. Technical completeness is valuable but not required - a well-communicated partial solution with clear documentation of challenges and decisions is preferred over a complete but poorly explained implementation.

### Core Functionality:

Your service must implement the following features:

1.  **Create Wallet:**
    * **Endpoint:** `POST /wallets`
    * **Request Body:** `{ "name": "My Personal Wallet" }` (or similar user-friendly name)
    * **Action:** Create a new Fireblocks Vault Account. Store the `vaultAccountId` returned by Fireblocks along with the user-friendly name in your PostgreSQL database.
    * **Response:** Details of the created wallet, including its local ID, name, and Fireblocks Vault ID.

2.  **Get Wallet Balance:**
    * **Endpoint:** `GET /wallets/{walletId}/assets/{assetId}/balance`
    * **Path Parameters:**
        * `walletId`: The local ID of the wallet stored in your database.
        * `assetId`: The Fireblocks asset ID (e.g., `TEST_BTC`, `TEST_ETH_TEST3` for Goerli ETH).
    * **Action:** Retrieve the balance for the specified `assetId` within the corresponding Fireblocks Vault Account.
    * **Response:** The asset balance details.

3.  **Get Deposit Address:**
    * **Endpoint:** `GET /wallets/{walletId}/assets/{assetId}/address`
    * **Path Parameters:** (Same as Get Wallet Balance)
    * **Action:** Retrieve a deposit address for the specified `assetId` within the corresponding Fireblocks Vault Account.
    * **Response:** The deposit address details.

4.  **Initiate Transfer:**
    * **Endpoint:** `POST /wallets/{walletId}/transactions`
    * **Path Parameters:** `walletId` (local ID of the source wallet).
    * **Request Body:**
        ```json
        {
          "assetId": "TEST_BTC", // Or other testnet asset
          "amount": "0.001",
          "destinationAddress": "some_external_testnet_address",
          "note": "Test transfer" // Optional
        }
        ```
    * **Action:** Create and submit a transaction using the Fireblocks API from the specified Vault Account.
    * **Response:** Details of the initiated transaction, including the Fireblocks `txId`.


## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

* **Language:** Go (latest stable version)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **ORM:** GORM (for database interactions and migrations)
* **HTTP Framework:** Standard library (`net/http`) or a lightweight framework of your choice (e.g., Gin, Echo, Chi).
* **Fireblocks API:** You will be provided with a **testnet** API key and secret separately. **Do NOT commit these credentials to your repository.**
* **Code Management:** Git.
* **Testing:**
    * Unit tests for key business logic (e.g., service layer functions, wallet operations).
* **Configuration:** Application configuration (like database connection strings, Fireblocks API details) should be managed via environment variables. Provide a `.env.example` file.

## 🔥 Fireblocks API Interaction

* You will primarily interact with the Fireblocks API. Refer to the [Fireblocks API Documentation](https://developers.fireblocks.com/reference/introduction) for details on authentication, request signing, and specific endpoints.
* Key endpoints you'll likely use:
    * `POST /v1/vault/accounts`
    * `GET /v1/vault/accounts/{vaultAccountId}/{assetId}`
    * `GET /v1/vault/accounts/{vaultAccountId}/{assetId}/addresses_paginated` (or `POST .../addresses` to generate a new one if needed)
    * `POST /v1/transactions`
* **Security:** Ensure secure handling of the Fireblocks API key and secret. These should be configurable via environment variables and **never hardcoded or committed.**

## 💧 Obtaining Testnet Assets

To fully test the wallet service functionality, you'll need testnet cryptocurrency assets in your Fireblocks vault accounts. These can be obtained from public testnet faucets.

**Important Notes:**
* Only use testnet assets for this exercise - never use real cryptocurrency
* Testnet assets have no monetary value and are meant solely for development and testing
* You'll need to generate deposit addresses using your wallet service and fund them via these faucets
* Some faucets may have rate limits or require social verification to prevent abuse

Once you have testnet assets in your vault accounts, you can fully test the balance retrieval and transfer functionality of your wallet service.

## 🗄️ Database Schema (Suggestion)

You should define your database schema using GORM migrations. Here's a suggested starting point:

* **`wallets` table:**
    * `id` (Primary Key, e.g., UUID or auto-incrementing int)
    * `name` (string, user-friendly name)
    * `fireblocks_vault_id` (string, unique, indexed)
    * `created_at` (timestamp)
    * `updated_at` (timestamp)


Feel free to adapt or extend this schema as you see fit.

## 🚢 Deliverables

Please provide the following:

1.  **A link to a public GitHub repository** containing your complete solution.
2.  **A comprehensive `README.md` file** (this file, but updated by you) that includes:
    * A brief overview of your solution, any assumptions made, and key design choices.
    * Clear instructions on how to set up the development environment (dependencies, Go version, database setup, etc.).
    * Instructions on how to configure the application (especially Fireblocks API key/secret via environment variables).
    * Step-by-step instructions on how to build and run the application.
    * Instructions on how to run any tests you've written.
    * API documentation for the endpoints you've created. This can be a simple list with request/response examples, a Postman collection, or a Swagger/OpenAPI specification.

## 🤝 Collaboration & Support

**This exercise is as much about collaboration as it is about coding.** We want to see how you work with a team, read documentation, and communicate challenges.

* **Dedicated Slack Channel:** You'll be invited to a private Slack channel for direct communication with our team.
* **Asynchronous Collaboration (Preferred):** We especially value engineers who can collaborate effectively without constant real-time interaction:
    * **Slack:** Share progress updates, ask specific questions, and document decisions
    * **Loom Videos:** Record screen shares to explain challenges, demonstrate progress, or walk through API documentation findings
    * **GitHub:** Use commit messages, issues, or discussions to document your thought process
    * **Structured Updates:** Provide clear status updates including what you've accomplished, current blockers, and next steps

**What We Want to See:**
* Proactive communication about progress and blockers
* Thoughtful questions that show you've done research first
* Documentation of your problem-solving process
* Clear explanations of trade-offs and decisions
* Effective use of Fireblocks documentation and resources

**Remember:** A well-documented partial solution with clear communication is more valuable than a complete solution with no explanation of the journey.

## ⏰ Submission Guidelines

* Please aim to spend no more than **6-8 hours of development time** on this exercise. We understand you have other commitments; this is a guideline, not a strict deadline. **Focus on demonstrating your problem-solving approach and communication skills over technical completeness.**
* Share your public GitHub repository.
* **Important:** Ensure your Fireblocks API key and secret are **NOT** committed to the repository. Your `README.md` should explain how to configure these (e.g., via environment variables in a `.env` file that is gitignored).
